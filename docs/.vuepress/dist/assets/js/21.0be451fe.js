The form most widely practiced is the Usui System of Natural Healing. In 1922 Mikao Usui, who maintained a holistic lifestyle, founded the Japanese version of the energy practice he connected to on a pilgrimage in India. Usui students then popularized it in America which has lead to it becoming “McReiki’d” (a drive-thru version) over time. The Origin of the ancient teachings can be found in the Vedas which trace back to as far as 1500c-500 BCE. The Vedic lifestyle was later labelled as Hinduism by the British when India was colonized by Britain. The parts of the Vedas more commercially accepted are widely known as the yogic lifestyle. A hatha class on Sunday , drinking all week and avoiding healing of past traumas does not qualify. Holistic healing practitioners, especially those teaching others to offer their own healing services, must assume the responsibility to not only maintain a yogic lifestyle themselves but to also pass this inner integrity on to their future students. Regardless of whether practitioners have been working unconsciously until this point, the power to self correct, to cleanse and grow is in the gift of every waking morning.
